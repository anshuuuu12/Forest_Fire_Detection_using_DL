Forest Fire Detection using Deep Learning 🌲🔥
This project focuses on detecting forest fires using deep learning techniques. It leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify images and predict fire outbreaks. The model is trained on a dataset of fire and non-fire images to enhance early detection and response.
